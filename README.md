## Analysis of E-commerce Company's Platform Performance and Customer Expenditure

## Background:
The e-commerce company based in New York City sells clothing online and offers in-store style and clothing advice sessions. They are considering whether to focus their efforts on enhancing their mobile app experience or improving their website.

## Analysis Overview:
A predictive model was created to understand the relationship between customer behavior and their expenditures. From the model's results, it's observed that the 'Length of Membership' strongly correlates with the 'Yearly Amount Spent', indicating a key driver of sales.

## Model Performance:
  *	Mean Absolute Error: 7.23
  * Mean Squared Error: 8.93
  *	Variance Score (RÂ²): 0.989

## Key Findings:
1. Regression Analysis:
    *	The model indicated the following impacts on total spending:
    *	Avg. Session Length: +$25.98
    *	Time on App: +$38.59
    *	Time on Website: +$0.19
    *	Length of Membership: +$61.27

2. Correlation and Impact:
    *	Time on App: The coefficient is 0.029. With an intercept of 3.18, the time spent on the app seems to be a positive factor in increasing expenditure.
    *	Time on Website: The coefficient is -0.047. The intercept is 5.28, indicating that more time on the website correlates with lesser spending compared to the app.
    *	The 'Time on App' showed a notably stronger positive correlation with spending compared to the 'Time on Website.'

3. Recommendations:
    *	Focus on Mobile App:
    *	Given the substantial impact of 'Time on App' and its higher coefficient, the company might benefit from focusing more on enhancing its mobile app experience.
    *	Consider optimizing the app for a more user-friendly, engaging, and seamless shopping experience.

4. Considerations for Decision-Making:
    *	Understand user behavior and preferences regarding the in-store sessions and their impact on online purchases.
    *	Conduct user surveys or interviews to gather qualitative data on preferences and pain points.

5. Development Strategy:
    *	To make an informed decision, consider conducting A/B testing or targeted marketing campaigns to assess the impact of improvements on the app and website.
    *	Invest in enhancing the website to bring it closer in performance to the app. This could involve improving user interface, personalization, and engagement features.

6. Future Steps:
    *	Continuously monitor and analyze user behavior and spending patterns.
    *	Implement regular updates and improvements based on user feedback and data analysis.
    *	Consider implementing loyalty programs or targeted incentives to encourage app usage and increase customer retention.

## Conclusion: 
Based on the provided data and analysis, focusing efforts on enhancing the mobile app experience seems advantageous due to its stronger impact on customer spending. However, a holistic approach that includes improvements to both the app and website while considering user behavior and loyalty could yield the best results.
